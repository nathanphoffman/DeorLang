# Structs

## Declaration

```deor
struct Room
    Squarefeet area
    string name
    bool occupied
```

```rust
#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Room {
    area: Option<Squarefeet>,
    name: String,
    occupied: bool,
}
```

Struct fields may be primitives, validator types, list shapes, or other structs. Func shapes as struct fields are a transpiler error — structs are pure data. See [Shapes — Func Shapes in Structs](docs/shapes.md#func-shapes-in-structs).

**Caveat:** field *name* rules (min length, snake_case) and the func-shape rejection above are checked at validation time. The field *type* itself is not — if you misspell a type name or reference one that was never declared, the transpiler doesn't catch it. It silently passes through to codegen, which emits the bogus name as-is, and the failure only shows up as a confusing `rustc` error against the generated `.rs` file (e.g. "cannot find type `Bogs` in this scope") rather than a clear message pointing at your `.deor` source. Double-check field type spelling by hand.

There are no per-field visibility modifiers — all fields are always accessible via destructuring whenever the struct itself is in scope.

Structs are immutable — the only way to get a "changed" version is [Record Update](#record-update-with) below, or recomposing it entirely. See [Immutability](docs/immutability.md#mutability-rules).

---

## Struct Construction

Structs can be constructed with an explicit type (`Type name = (fields)`) or inferred via `as` (`name as (fields)`). The transpiler matches field names to determine the struct type. Every field must already be a variable in scope matching the field name exactly. No `{}`, no `field: value` pairs.

### Inferred with `as`

A parenthesised field list `(f1, f2, ...)` constructs a struct. All items must be named variables already in scope whose names match the target struct's fields. The struct type is inferred by matching field names against all known structs — no type annotation needed.

Deor:
```deor
score as (label, points)    # struct type inferred from field names
```

Rust:
```rust
let score = Score { label: label.clone(), points: points.clone() };
```

### Explicit Type

Deor:
```deor
Squarefeet area = 9
name as "Office"
occupied as true
Room room = (area, name, occupied)
```

Rust:
```rust
let area = Squarefeet::new(9);
let name = "Office".to_string();
let occupied = true;
let room = Room { area, name, occupied };
```

Mirrors destructuring: `in` pulls fields out of a struct, `= (field1, field2,...)` forms a struct, `with` constructs a struct. See [Enforced Practices — Unified `()` Rule](docs/enforced_practices.md#unified-rule-named-variables) for the field-matching/order rule shared across construction, destructuring, and return.

### As an Expression

`(fields)` can also appear as a bare expression in return position — no type annotation needed, since the function's declared return type already determines which struct is expected. See [Functions — Multiple return values](docs/functions.md#multiple-return-values) for the full worked example (`DivResult`/`divmod`).

If you need a field name that differs from the variable you have, rename it first:

```deor
name in other_room
label = name
Entry entry = (label)
```

---

## Destructuring (`in`)

`in` extracts one or more fields from a struct into the current scope. This is the only way to access struct fields — there is no dot syntax in source, so every field a block of code touches is named up front in one place, instead of scattered across dot-chains wherever they happen to get used.

Parentheses are always required, even for a single field. Deor calls this **bagging**: items come out of (or go into) the struct under their original field name — there is no aliasing.

### Single Field
Deor:
```deor
(area) in room
```
Rust:
```rust
let area = room.area.clone();
```

### Multiple Fields
Deor:
```deor
(area, name) in room
```
Rust:
```rust
let area = room.area.clone();
let name = room.name.clone();
```

Each extracted field becomes its own `let field = src.field.clone();` binding — not a Rust pattern destructure.

### Partial Extraction
You can extract a subset of a struct's fields. Any combination is valid — the struct may have more fields than you extract.

```deor
struct Room
    Squarefeet area
    string name
    bool occupied

(name) in room          # valid — ignores area and occupied
(area, occupied) in room  # valid — any subset, any order
```

### Shadowing
If a name being extracted already exists in scope, the new binding silently shadows it — the same block-scoped shadowing rules apply as anywhere else in Deor. See [Enforced Practices — Variable Shadowing](docs/enforced_practices.md#variable-shadowing) for the full mechanics.

```deor
name as "Alice"
(name) in employee    # name now refers to employee.name — "Alice" is gone
```

Use this deliberately to "update" a name after processing, or avoid it by choosing distinct names.

A **further thought** on shadowing: Deor does not shy away from ```macros```, as a result shadowing is necessary to prevent collision, Deor also accepts its Rust lineage and since Rust supports this it seemed like an obvious feature to keep. This also aligns with the default import philosophy which is to silently swallow same-imports as they are already imported. If you don't want to silently swallow a duplicate definition, the best approach is to use a ```const```, as they will not allow shadowing.

## Record Update (`with`)

`with` produces a new struct with one or more fields overridden. The original is unchanged. Each field name must already exist as a variable in scope — the same rule as struct literals.

Works with both binding forms — `as` (type inferred from the source struct) and a typed declaration (`Type name = source with (...)`, as seen in [Updating a Struct Inside a List](docs/collections.md#updating-a-struct-inside-a-list)):

- Single field: `new_room as room with (area)` — parens always required, even for one field
- Multiple fields: `new_room as room with (area, name)`

The transpiler enforces the parens: `with` not immediately followed by `(` is a validation error, for both forms.

Deor:
```deor
Squarefeet area = 2
new_room as room with (area)

area = 20
name as "Bigger Office"
bigger_office as office with (area, name)
```

Rust:
```rust
let mut area: Option<Squarefeet> = Squarefeet::new(2);
let new_room = Room { area, ..room.clone() };

area = Squarefeet::new(20);
let name = "Bigger Office".to_string();
let bigger_office = Room { area, name, ..office.clone() };
```

**Conversion notes:** near 1:1 with Rust's built-in functional record update (`..` spread) syntax, except the spread source is cloned (`..room.clone()`, not `..room`) — every Deor struct derives `Clone`, so `with` never consumes the source; `room`/`office` are still fully usable after the update. Overridden fields that are validator types route through their constructor like any other assignment to that type. The `with` pattern mirrors `in` destructuring: `in` pulls fields out of a struct, `with` pushes variables into one.

---

## Move Variants

`move (f1, f2) in source` destructures without cloning, and `Type name = move (fields)` constructs without cloning — both consume the source variables. See [Move — Destructuring](docs/move.md#destructuring) and [Move — Struct Construction](docs/move.md#struct-construction) for the full examples and rules.

---

## Field Ordering

Even though order is not enforced, write fields in the same order they appear in the struct declaration if possible. It makes construction and destructuring sites easier to scan and keeps things consistent across the codebase.

```deor
struct Employee
    int employee_id
    string first_name
    string last_name

(employee_id, first_name, last_name) in employee
Employee emp = (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
emp as (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
```

Additionally, all `in` extractions should appear before any logic (assignments, expressions, control flow) within their block. Applies to function bodies, loop bodies, and if/else bodies.

**Correct:**
```deor
fn RollResult roll_die(Die die)

    (sides, label) in die

    min as 1
    int raw = m_rand_int(min, sides)

    Roll value = raw
    string source = label
    RollResult result = (value, source)

    return result
```
