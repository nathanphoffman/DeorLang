# Deor Language Specification (Draft)

A small, indentation-based language that transpiles to Rust. Core influences: TypeScript's literal-derived typing (`as const`), Python's indentation and `for x in y`, and Go/C's prefix type declarations (`Type name`).

## Core Principles

- **No dots.** Field access is via destructuring (`area in room`), not `.field`.
- **No colons for blocks.** Indentation alone opens a block after a header keyword (`fn`, `if`, `for`, `type`, `struct`).
- **One statement per line.** Multi-line expressions only wrap inside `()` or `[]`.
- **`as`** = "derive this binding's type from its shape" — for scalar literals, struct construction `(fields)`, list construction `[items]`, and record update `with`. No explicit type annotation is ever written with `as` (`count as 0`, not `int count as 0`). Use `Type name = expr` for function calls and computations.
- **`in`** = "extract something from a source" — struct fields, collection elements, or module contents, all one grammar.
- **Structs are immutable.** Primitives and lists are mutable.
- **`is` is always structural equality**, regardless of how a struct is represented internally. `is not` is inequality. `&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=` are transpiler errors — use `and`, `or`, `is`, `is not`.
- **No lambdas.** Only named top-level `fn`s. No built-in `filter`/`map`/`reduce` — write explicit loops.
- **Void functions omit the return type.** `fn run()` returns nothing. No `void` keyword.
- **`[using alias: T->O]` for behavior injection.** Annotate a function to accept a named external function. Call site provides it with `using fn_name`. Alias is called in the body. Required — omitting `using fn_name` at the call site is a transpiler error.
- **Struct construction uses `()`, always.** `room as (area, name)` — every field is a variable already in scope matching the field name. No `{}`, no `field: value` pairs. Mirrors destructuring: `(area, name) in room` extracts, `room as (area, name)` constructs.
- **Validator types are option-types.** A `type` definition produces `Option<T>` under the hood — truthy when `Some`, falsy when `None`. Primitives and structs are never null. Three null-related forms: `Roll roll = none` (declare absent), `(roll is known)` (forced unwrap — panics if None), `roll else 0` (safe default).
- **Rust interop is a first-class escape hatch.** `rust` blocks drop into raw Rust inside any function. External `.rs` files import via `rust:myfile`. Cargo deps declared with `deps` blocks. `deor:` stdlib wraps common crates and `std` modules. `bytes` (`Vec<u8>`) is the boundary type for raw binary data.
